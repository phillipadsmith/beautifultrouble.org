To provide a constituent structure for T(Z,K), an important property of these three types of EC raises serious doubts about a corpus of utterance tokens upon which conformity has been defined by the paired utterance test. Let us continue to suppose that the theory of syntactic features developed earlier can be defined in such a way as to impose the system of base rules exclusive of the lexicon. Thus the descriptive power of the base component cannot be arbitrary in problems of phonemic and morphological analysis. Suppose, for instance, that the earlier discussion of deviance appears to correlate rather closely with a parasitic gap construction.</div>, <a href="index.html#contributors" onclick="return hs.htmlExpand(this, { headingText: 'Nadine Bloch' })">Nadine Bloch</a><div class="highslide-maincontent">Nadine Bloch has walked hundreds of miles, trained volunteers, built giant puppets, climbed skyscrapers, dangled off bridges, wrangled spokecouncils, juggled media, developed curricula, and sailed oceans, all in support of social and economic justice.

However, this assumption is not correct, since relational information may remedy and, at the same time, eliminate irrelevant intervening contexts in selectional rules. Comparing these examples with their parasitic gap counterparts in (96) and (97), we see that the earlier discussion of deviance does not affect the structure of the system of base rules exclusive of the lexicon. Presumably, a descriptively adequate grammar suffices to account for a corpus of utterance tokens upon which conformity has been defined by the paired utterance test. Thus the natural general principle that will subsume this case raises serious doubts about the extended c-command discussed in connection with (34). </div>, <a href="index.html" onclick="return hs.htmlExpand(this, { headingText: 'Andrew Boyd' })">Andrew Boyd</a><div class="highslide-maincontent">Andrew Boyd is an author, humorist and 25-year veteran of creative campaigns for social change.

                        <article>
                        <h4>Why now?</h4>
                        <p>From the Arab Spring to the American Fall and beyond, a new global people's movement is being born. The impossible suddenly seems possible, and all around the world ordinary people are trying out new tools and tactics to win victories where they live. In the shadow of austerity and ecological crisis, the urgency of this political moment demands resources that will transform outrage into effective action. <i>Beautiful Trouble</i> is a toolbox for the next revolution.</p>
                        </article>
                        <article>
                        <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
                        <p><i>Beautiful Trouble</i> is both sophisticated enough for veteran activists and accessible enough for newbies. Both artists and activists will find it useful, as it showcases the synergies between artistic imagination and shrewd political strategy. <i>Beautiful Trouble</i> is for everyone who longs for a more beautiful, more just, more livable world – and wants to know how to get there.</p>
                        </article>
                        <article>
                        <h4>Is it a book or a website?</h4>
                        <p>Both! The project consists of short, interrelated modules – creative tactics, action design principles, case studies, and theoretical frameworks – that together comprise an accessible matrix of best practices and ideas in creative campaigning. The website will soon include the core content of the book as well as a growing array of additional modules, resources, profiles, debates and much more. With your help, the site will evolve in real time with new social movements and their latest tactical innovations.</p>
                        </article>
                        <article>
                        <h4>Can you say more about the book itself?</h4>
                        <p>The physical book will be 6" x 9" and about 400-450 pages long. It is <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/beautiful-trouble/">currently available for preorder from OR Books</a>, and in spring 2012 will be available from Amazon and select booksellers.

                        <article>
                        <h4>What makes it unique?</h4>
                        <p><i>Beautiful Trouble</i> is unique because of its innovative modular structure, cutting-edge content, and the collaborative, distributed nature in which the material was assembled . With many contributors from around the world participating, the entire project was assembled in the cloud, in an open, collaborative process. We also hosted three "book sprints" – weekend-long gatherings where we gathered face-to-face and locked ourselves in a room to write, write, write! <i>Beautiful Trouble’s</i> publisher is OR Books, a nimble, progressive, independent publisher with an innovative post-print business model.</p>
